# FinTalk-Swift
"Intro to Swift" Source Code and PowerPoint presented at ParivedaSolutions 6/17/16. This repository contains 3 basic components.

## 1. Source Code
This project relies on Cocoapods as it's dependency manager and will need to be installed on your machine in order to run. You can find setup instructions here (https://cocoapods.org/).

The purpose of this application is to highlight one entire "workflow". I define workflow as capturing a complete technical implementation of a single user action - in this instance, loggin in. You'll find examples of setting up the UI, capturing UI events in the controller, forwarding business logic into a services layers, which manages sending out API requests to a remote repository for validation, and then persisting those changes locally.

In order for theremote API we're hitting here to work you will need valid lds.org credentials. I used this endpoint because it was easy to use and I already have an account, thus making it easy for demo purposes.

## 2. Powerpoint (i.e. Intro_to_Swift.pptx)
This is the PowerPoint deck I used for my presentation and contains a brief history of the Swift language, some comparisons to Objective-C, and some additional resources if you'd like to learn more.

## 3. Video Screenshare (i.e. Zoom)
This is the video recording of my presentation. I forgot to start the recording until I was already 15 minutes in, but all you miss essentially is me walking through the first few slides of the PowerPoint, and me setting up the first bit of Cocoapods. Cocoapods is rather straigh forward so you can go here (https://cocoapods.org/) to see the steps that I took to set this up.
